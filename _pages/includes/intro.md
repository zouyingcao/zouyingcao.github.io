# <font color="Pink">‚ùÄ</font> Biography

I am now a M.S. student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhaohai/). 
Before that, I received a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), in 2023.
In my undergraduate stage, I have participated in several research projects to explore my interest in computer science. 
Foremost among them is a personal scientific research project related to order dispatching which raised my curiosity in reinforcement learning and data mining.

Thinking of the current postgraduate stage, it was literally a serendipity that I began to work on researches in Large Language Models (LLMs).
I worked on several interesting research topics related to LLMs, including hallucination, model compression and representation engineering.
Currently, I am working as a research intern at Alibaba, primarily focusing on LLM agents.
